## 💰 Pricing Psychology

### Why $9.99 Works

- Feels less than $10 (psychological)
- Less than one winning bet
- Recurring = $120/year
- Industry standard for tools

### Anchor Pricing

Present options:
- ❌ Free (limited)
- ✅ Premium $9.99/mo ← Most popular (highlight this)
- 👑 Pro $29.99/mo

**Most choose the middle option.**

### Discount Strategy

**DON'T:** Constantly discount (devalues product)

**DO:** Strategic discounts:
- Black Friday: 50% off first month
- New followers: "First 100 members get $5/mo for life"
- Yearly option: $99/year (save $20)

---

## 📈 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

**Goal:** Maximize how much each follower is worth over time

### Example Customer Journey:

**Month 1:**
- Finds you on TikTok (free)
- Uses PropStats free tier (free)
- Signs up for PrizePicks via your link → **$50 commission**

**Month 2:**
- Hits free limit
- Upgrades to Premium → **$9.99/month**

**Month 3:**
- Joins Discord → **$19.99/month**
- Still has Premium → **$9.99/month**
- **Total: $29.98/month**

**Month 4-12:**
- Remains subscribed
- **9 months × $29.98 = $269.82**

**One customer value:** $50 (affiliate) + $269.82 (subs) = **$319.82**

**With 1,000 followers:**
- If 5% convert to paid: 50 customers
- 50 × $319.82 = **$15,991 revenue**

## 🚫 Common Monetization Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Selling Too Early
- Don't promote affiliate day 1
- Build trust for 2-3 weeks first
- Focus on value, money follows

### Mistake 2: Too Many CTAs
- Don't promote everything at once
- Focus on ONE main offer per video
- Rotate promotions

### Mistake 3: Not Tracking
- Must know which revenue stream works
- Track everything in spreadsheet
- Double down on winners

### Mistake 4: Underpricing
- Don't charge $4.99 for premium
- $9.99 is standard, it works
- Value your expertise

### Mistake 5: Overcomplicating
- Start with 1-2 revenue streams
- Master those first
- Add more after proven

---

## 💰 The Reality

**Month 1 expectations:**
- You'll make $100-500 (not $10k)
- Most followers won't buy anything
- That's normal

**The math:**
- 5,000 followers
- 2% conversion to paid = 100 customers
- 50 × $50 (affiliate) = $2,500
- 30 × $9.99 (premium) = $300
- 20 × $19.99 (Discord) = $400
- **Total: $3,200**

**But first you need 5,000 followers.**

**That requires 50-100 good videos.**

**Which requires 30-60 days of consistency.**
