## 💪 Mindset

**Most people quit after 10 videos.**

If you post 3x daily for 30 days (90 videos), you'll be ahead of 95% of creators.

Your first videos will suck. That's normal. Every big creator's first 50 videos were terrible.

**The algorithm rewards consistency and engagement, not perfection.**
