## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

### The Non-Negotiables:

1. **POST EVERY SINGLE DAY**
   - Miss one day = algorithm reset
   - Consistency > quality (at first)

2. **ENGAGE WITH EVERY COMMENT**
   - First hour after posting
   - This boosts the algorithm

3. **TRACK EVERYTHING**
   - What time performs best?
   - Which content gets views?
   - What makes people click bio?

4. **PROVIDE VALUE FIRST**
   - Don't sell on day 1
   - Build trust with free value
   - Money follows trust

5. **NEVER GIVE UP BEFORE 100 VIDEOS**
   - First 10 videos will flop
   - First 50 videos are practice
   - Video 73 might go viral
   - You never know which one hits

## 🎯 When Things Go Wrong

### "My videos aren't getting views"
- Check: Are you using trending sounds?
- Check: Is your hook strong? (first 3 seconds)
- Check: Are you posting at peak times?
- Solution: Keep posting, test different hooks

### "No one is clicking my bio link"
- Check: Are you mentioning it in videos?
- Check: Is your bio clear and compelling?
- Solution: Stronger CTAs in content

### "I don't know what to post"
- Check: VIDEO_SCRIPT_TEMPLATES.md
- Check: CONTENT_CALENDAR_TEMPLATE.md
- Solution: Copy templates exactly at first

### "I'm losing motivation"
- Remember: It takes 50-100 videos to pop
- Check: Your week 1 metrics vs now (you're growing!)
- Solution: Find an accountability partner

**TODAY.**

Everything else is just planning.

The algorithm rewards action, not perfection.
